/**

 * README file for Workbench Moderation.
 */

This is an experimental branch of workbench_moderation that integrates ERS and State Machine
with a "Workbench Machine" connector module. Workbench States, Workbench Events and Workbench
Workflows hold configuration objects that Workbench Machine uses.

While I think this architecture is moving in the right direction I don't yet know the what
the names of of all these modules will end up being or what package they'll live in.
